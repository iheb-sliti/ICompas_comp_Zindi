TUNIZI is the first 100% Tunisian Arabizi sentiment analysis dataset, developed as part of AI4Dâ€™s ongoing NLP project for African languages. Tunisian Arabizi is the representation of the Tunisian dialect written in Latin characters and numbers rather than Arabic letters.

iCompass gathered comments from social media platforms that express sentiment about popular topics. For this purpose, we extracted 100k comments using public streaming APIs.

Tunizi was preprocessed by removing links, emoji symbols, and punctuations.

The collected comments were manually annotated using an overall polarity: positive (1), negative (-1) and neutral (0). The annotators were diverse in gender, age and social background.
